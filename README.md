# MACE_extraction
MACE_extraction aims to identify the presence of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) from unstructured clinical notes through natural language processing. Using a defined dictionary of MACE keywords, relevant sentences are first extracted from the reports. Then, each report is classified as a positive, negative, or uncertain MACE finding.

While the project was developed using clinical notes from the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset, it can be used to extract MACE from any set of free-text reports.
