# MACE Extraction
This project aims to identify the presence of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) from unstructured clinical notes through natural language processing. Using a defined dictionary of MACE keywords, relevant sentences are first extracted from the reports. Then, each report is classified as a positive or negative MACE finding. Negative findings include a history, a risk, family history, or uncertain existence of MACE. 

This project was developed using the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset, containing clinical notes from patients at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts.
